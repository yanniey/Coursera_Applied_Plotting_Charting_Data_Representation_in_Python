Enable matplotlib in Jupyter Notbooks:

```
%matplotlib notebook
%matplotlib inline
```

inline will make matplotlib render into the browser

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot?
```

pyplot is the scripting layer which saves time for the processing

gcf() = get current figure
gca() = get current axis
